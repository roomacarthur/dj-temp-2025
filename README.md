### Virtual environments

As always it is crucial to have a virtual environment setup for development.

`venv/`
`.venv/`

Both of the above are ignored in the `.gitignore` file.

To create a virtual environment, run the following command in the terminal.
`python -m venv venv`

and to activate the virtual environment, run the following command in the terminal.
`source venv/bin/activate # on mac`

`source venv/scripts/activate # on windows`
